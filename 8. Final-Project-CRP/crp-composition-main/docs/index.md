[MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/) is a project on music
generation. In a nutshell, we aim to generate polyphonic music of multiple
tracks (instruments). The proposed models are able to generate music either from
scratch, or by accompanying a track given a priori by the user.

We train the model with training data collected from
[Lakh Pianoroll Dataset](https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/)
to generate pop song phrases consisting of bass, drums, guitar, piano and
strings tracks.

Listen to some of the best samples.
